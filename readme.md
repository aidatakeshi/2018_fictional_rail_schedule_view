This is my first trial of using Node.js & Express.js during 2018 - 19, for generating a working timetable of a fully fictional Japanese-style railway. This is a timetable viewer using Express.js + EJS + Bootstrap, including the following features:

* Line timetable
* Station timetable
* Viewing "train runs" (daily duty of train trips for a trainset)

Timetable data is retrieved from MongoDB database defined in mongodb_conn.js.

The code for this project is for study purposes only.
